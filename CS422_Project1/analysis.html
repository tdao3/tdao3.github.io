	<h2> Why is this a good design? </h2>
	<p> I think this is a good design for various reason. First would be that 
	it is quite simple without not too many dials or sliders to worry about. You are 
	mainly pressing up and down for each setting you want.

	It keeps it simplier by not including too many presets such as different variety 
	of foods. Most of the time I find myself not using the presets anyways. So the 
	normal bake, broil and toast presets were what I mainly focused on. I wanted to
	keep the simplicity of it by getting rid of screen clutter where I could. So that is 
	why I had the options disapper once another button was pressed since there is no 
	need to display the modes more than one place on the screen. The toaster oven itself
	also spells out what you are setting, so Temp says temp set, same with timer that says 
	timer set.</p>
