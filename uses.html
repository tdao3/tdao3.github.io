	<!-- USES of a toaster -->
	<h2>Different Uses</h2>

	<!-- Talk about the interface -->
	<h3>User Interaction</h3>
	<p> Depending on what you are making, the process used when operating the toaster </br>oven 
		would be different, but the general idea should be the same. The steps are as followed:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Pull open the door handle and put your food/ingredients in</li>
		<li>Close the door</li>
		<li>Decide what mode you need for your food</li>
		<p class="p3">Are you heating up food? </br>
			Are you baking? </br>
			Are you broiling? </br>
			Are you toasting? </br>
		</p>
		<li>Open door using the handle by pulling the door towards you</li>
		<li>Put the food into the oven, pulling out the tray if needed</li>
		<li>Choose the appropriate temperature and turn the dial</li>
		<li>Turn the knob to the appropriate mode</li>
		<li>The last step is to set the timer following the instruction near the dial</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="p4">The interface of the toaster is quite simple with only a few components that need 
	adjusting and setting. The simplicity of it makes it easier for the user to complete 
	the steps without confusion. The only slighty confusing step would be to set the timer,
	but there are small text instructions near the knob that guide an inexperienced user
	on their first time using it. There are no buttons that need to be pressed or switches
	to turn on.
