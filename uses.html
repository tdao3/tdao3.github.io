		<li>Close the door</li>
		<li>Decide what mode you need for your food</li>
		<p class="p3">Are you heating up food? </br>
			Are you baking? </br>
			Are you broiling? </br>
			Are you toasting? </br>
		</p>
		<li>Turn the knob to the appropriate mode</li>
		<li>Choose the appropriate temperature and turn the dial</li>
