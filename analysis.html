	<h2>Interface</h2>
	<p>In this analysis we will tackle to answer some questions relating to the usage of this toaster</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Does the interface make doing those common things easier?</li>
		<li>How does the toaster oven help the user figure out how to make it work?</li>
		<li>How does the toaster oven show the state of the system to the user?</li>
		<li>How easy is it for a guest to use this toaster oven?</li>
	</ol>

	<!-- Handle -->
	<h3>The Handle</h3>
	<p>The handle is made in a way so you are aware what you need to do is. It has a wide enough opening
	to fit a hand or a hand with gloves.</br> It also gives the user an idea of which way the oven door opens.
	It would not make sense to approach the handle and pull upwards or downwards.</br>A user would also not
	push against the handle. Since the handle is protruding towards the user, they would more naturally
	pull towards themselves.
