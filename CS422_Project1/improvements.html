	<!-- Pros -->
	<h2 class="h2">Advantages and Disadvantages</h2>
	<h3 class="gen">Pros</h3>
	<p>1.Handle</br>The handle is well constructed to be intuitive to use. There is not
	much room for confusion when trying to use the toaster oven.</br></br>
	
	2.Stainless Steel Finish</br>The finish is appealing to the eyes and looks more 
	high end. It is also easier to clean than a painted coating which could chip off
	or burn.</br></br>

	3.Notes on the upper left of each knob</br>
	This is a good inclusion because it adds more detail to each knob's function 
	without adding too much clutter around the actual circle.</br></br>

	4.Indicator light</br>
	The indicator light only turns on and off not having any additional colors
	which keeps the simplicity. Also does not require the user to understand what
	other colors such as "green" would mean. In some other toaster ovens, green 
	would mean that the temperature inside the oven is equal to the temperature 
	that the user set it to. But with relative values thats the toaster has, this
	option is not really necessary. Also the toaster is rarely used to bake where
	preheating is important.</br></br>

	5.Location of knobs</br>
	Having the knobs vertical gives an illusion of the steps you would take, going 
	from top to bottom. First adjusting the temp, then the mode, then finally turning on
	the oven itself. As opposed to a horizontal knob design where a user might jump
	back and forth between the knobs, this one is more user friendly.</br></br>
	</p>

	<!-- Cons -->
	<h4 class="gen">Cons</h3>
	<p class="p2">1.Glossy Finish</br>Although nice to look at, it makes it a bit more difficult than 
	needed when adjusting the knobs. Depending on the amount of light in the room, there
	is a good amount of glare on the numbers and letters.</br></br>

	2.Note to upper right of timer</br>
	The note is necessary because it is not obvious that you have to turn the dial first to
	20 before stopping at the correct time. The only bad part is that the text is a little
	obscure and easy to miss. So a normal user might just turn to the time they want and 
	leave it at that while assuming that it works.</br></br>

	3.No indicator of minutes</br>
	Around the timer there is no text or symbol indicating that the numbers on the dial 
	represent minutes, at first glance it is possbile to question that it is meant for 
	seconds rather than minutes. This is a bit misleading.</br></br>

	4.Location of light indicator</br>
	The location of the light indicator is kind of hidden, mostly if the oven is placed 
	somewhere lower and the user is taller. Asthetically it is better to have the light 
	more hidden, but if someone were to leave the oven on, on accident, it could be 
	more easily looked over than if it was placed above the knobs.</br></br>
	</p>

	<img class="controls2" src="controls2.png" alt="Image cannot be displayed">
	<h5 class="h2">Possible Improvements</h5>
	<p>The first improvement would be moving the location of the light indicator, moving it
	from the bottom right to the top right. This would allow the light to be more visible
	since the toaster will most likely be put lower than shoulder height when used. This 
	eliminates the need to bend down to see if the light is on or not.</br></br>

	The second addition would be the "Min" next to the upper right of the timer knob. This was 
	discussed in "Analysis" how no indicator of the time unit used for the timer could
	be an issue. This addition will indicate that the timer runs in minutes, eliminating any confusion 
	with the units of time that is used.</br></br>

	There would also be a change to the glossy finish of the control knobs. As the picture to the 
	left indicates, the shiny area would become black matte while the text would be changed to
	white to contrast the black. This would then get rid of the issue of lighting and glare
	when viewing the toaster options.</br></br>

	The last addition is moving the note from the upper right of the timer to right next to the 
	20 minute mark along with a tick mark. Originally this text was badly placed and formatted
	Moving it closer down will draw attention specifically to the 20 minute
	marker and gets the user to read the instructions on using the timer more. There is also less 
	text to get rid of clutter on the interface and around the knob. Without the "on" light being
	at the bottom, this text could also be moved to the bottom of the knob. I choose not to make this
	change because of how low the text will be from eye level, decreasing its visibility and noticeability
