	<h3>The Handle</h3>
	<p> The handle is made in a way so you are aware what you need to do is. It has a wide enough opening
	to fit a hand or a hand with gloves. It also gives the user an idea of which way the oven door opens.
	It would not make sense to approach the handle and pull upwards or downwards. A user would also not
	push against the handle. Since the handle is protruding towards the user, they would more naturally
	pull towards themselves.
