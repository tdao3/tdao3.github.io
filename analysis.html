	<!-- Interface -->
	<h2>Interface</h2>
	<p>In this analysis we will tackle to answer some questions relating to the usage of this toaster</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Does the interface make doing those common things easier?</li>
		<li>How does the toaster oven help the user figure out how to make it work?</li>
		<li>How does the toaster oven show the state of the system to the user?</li>
		<li>How easy is it for a guest to use this toaster oven?</li>
	</ol>

	<!-- Handle -->
	<h3 class="comp">The Handle</h3>
	<p>The handle is made in a way so you are aware what you need to do is. It has a wide enough opening
	to fit a hand or a hand with gloves. It also gives the user an idea of which way the oven door opens.
	It would not make sense to approach the handle and pull upwards or downwards. A user would also not
	push against the handle. Since the handle is protruding towards the user, they would more naturally
	pull towards themselves.
	</p>
	
	<!-- Temp Knob -->
	<h4 class="comp">Temperature Knob</h4>
	<p>The temperature knob, which is the first knob located at the very top, has numbers ranging from 
	450 to 200 in 50 degree intervals. It also has a small indicator on the top left of the knob, stating
	that the measurements are in Fahrenheit, but I believe that even without the note most users would
	assume that it is not in celsius because that would be a ridiculously hot temperature for a small oven to produce. 
	Past the 200 degrees mark states warm, meaning the user will most likely not need precise measurements for 
	temperatures below 200 degrees. At the end by the 450 mark, there is a note that says
	broil, which is a form of cooking that requires a high amount of direct heat. Onto the knob itself,
	there is a raised and protruding section that is representative of an arrow so the user would be aware
	of what temperature or mode they are currently at.</br></br>

	This interface is quite intuitive. One would move the dial to the appropriate temperature according to
	where the "arrow" is pointing. There is not much thought that needs to be put into the action when 
	someone approaches it. The numbers around the dial, and the note that says "Temp" also tell you what
	that specific knob is controlling within the oven.
	</p>

	<!-- Function Knob -->
	<h5 class="comp">Function Knob</h5>
	<p>The function knob has 4 different settings: Bake, Turbo, Broil, and Toast. The name themselves describe 
	what their functions are clearly. The knob is the same as the temperature knob and can be turned both 
	clockwise and counter clockwise, as with the temperature knob as well. On the upper left side there is a
	note that says "Function" indicating what this knob is used for.</br></br>

	This interface is also pretty straight forward, allowing you to choose the mode that you need. When turning
	the knob there is also a click for each mode you enter, so a user would know not to turn the arrow in 
	between modes, for example.
	</p>

	<!-- Timer Knob -->
	<h6 class="comp">Timer Knob</h5>
	<p>The Timer knob itself is similar to the other physically. On the circle, to the far left is Stay On.
	It would seem that is to keep the oven on indefinitely. To the right of the "Off" section there are numbers
	in 20 minute intervals. There is no actual indicator that the numbers mean minutes, but it is assumed 
	because a timer that only lasts 60 seconds is not as useful. Close to the "Off" section is two icons of
	what appears to be toast. One is white while the other is black, indicating the amount of "toasted" a
	user would like to have their bread be at. On the upper right hand side of the knob there is a note that
	directs the user on how to operate the timer, needing to turn it to 20 first then to the desired time.
	</br></br>

	This interface is a bit more difficult to figure out than the other two knobs. First being that stay on
	is before "Off" clockwise. One might be confused and see it as needing to rotate the knob completely 
	around first. Secondly, there is no indicator on whether the numbers mean minutes, seconds, days, years
	etc. Lastly is the function of turning the dial to 20 first then to the time you want. There is a reason
	for this, but if one was not to read the note on the side, a user would assume just turning the dial to
	the time you want is sufficient and do just that. The note itself is not that large and can be easily 
	overlooked as well.
	</p>

	<!-- Light Indicator -->
	<h6 class="comp">Light Indicator</h5>
	<p> At the bottom right corner of the toaster oven, there is a small red light indicator. This light
	turns on when the oven is turned on via the timer knob. When the timer is up or is turned off the 
	light will turn off.

	This is how the toaster oven indicates its state to the user. Even when plugged in the light will not
	turn on until the toaster itself is moved away from the off mode.
