	<!-- Pros -->
	<h2>Advantages and Disadvantages</h2>
	<h3 class="gen">Pros</h3>
	<p>1.Handle</br>The handle is well constructed to be intuitive to use. There is not
	much room for confusion when trying to use the toaster oven.</br></br>
	
	2.Stainless Steel Finish</br>The finish is appealing to the eyes and looks more 
	high end. It is also easier to clean than a painted coating which could chip off
	or burn.</br></br>

	3.Notes on the upper left of each knob</br>
	This is a good inclusion because it adds more detail to each knob's function 
	without adding too much clutter around the actual circle.</br></br>

	4.Indicator light</br>
	The indicator light only turns on and off not having any additional colors
	which keeps the simplicity. Also does not require the user to understand what
	other colors such as "green" would mean. In some other toaster ovens, green 
	would mean that the temperature inside the oven is equal to the temperature 
	that the user set it to. But with relative values thats the toaster has, this
	option is not really necessary. Also the toaster is rarely used to bake where
	preheating is important.</br></br>
	</p>

	<!-- Cons -->
	<h4 class="gen">Cons</h3>
	<p>1.Glossy Finish</br>Although nice to look at, it makes it a bit more difficult than 
	needed when adjusting the knobs. Depending on the amount of light in the room, there
	is a good amount of glare on the numbers and letters.</br></br>

	2.Note to upper right of timer</br>
	The note is necessary because it is not obvious that you have to turn the dial first to
	20 before stopping at the correct time. The only bad part is that the text is a little
	obscure and easy to miss. So a normal user might just turn to the time they want and 
	leave it at that while assuming that it works.</br></br>

	3.No indicator of minutes</br>
	Around the timer there is no text or symbol indicating that the numbers on the dial 
	represent minutes, at first glance it is possbile to question that it is meant for 
	seconds rather than minutes. This is a bit misleading.</br></br>
