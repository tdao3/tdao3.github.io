	<!-- Interface -->
	<h2>Interface</h2>
	<p>In this analysis we will tackle to answer some questions relating to the usage of this toaster</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Does the interface make doing those common things easier?</li>
		<li>How does the toaster oven help the user figure out how to make it work?</li>
		<li>How does the toaster oven show the state of the system to the user?</li>
		<li>How easy is it for a guest to use this toaster oven?</li>
	</ol>

	<!-- Handle -->
	<h3>The Handle</h3>
	<p>The handle is made in a way so you are aware what you need to do is. It has a wide enough opening
	to fit a hand or a hand with gloves.</br> It also gives the user an idea of which way the oven door opens.
	It would not make sense to approach the handle and pull upwards or downwards.</br>A user would also not
	push against the handle. Since the handle is protruding towards the user, they would more naturally
	pull towards themselves.

	<!-- Temp Knob -->
	<h4 class="comp">Temperature Knob</h4>
	<p>The temperature knob, which is the first knob located at the very top, has numbers ranging from 
	450 to 200 in 50 degree intervals. It also has a small indicator on the top left of the knob, stating
	that the measurements are in Fahrenheit, but I believe that even without the note most users would
	assume that it is not in celcius because that would be a ridiciously hot temperature for a small oven to produce. Past the 200 degrees mark states warm, meaning the user will most likely not need precise measurements for temperatures below 200 degrees. At the end by the 450 mark, there is a note that says
	broil, which is a form of cooking that requires a high amont of direct heat. Onto the knob itself,
	there is a raised and protruding section that is representative of an arrow so the user would be aware
	of what temperature or mode they are currently at.</br> 

	This interface is quite intuitive. One would move the dial to the appropriate temperature according to
	where the "arrow" is pointing. There is not much thought that needs to be put into the action when 
	someone approaches it. The numbers around the dial, and the note that says "Temp" also tell you what
	that specific knob is controlling within the oven.
