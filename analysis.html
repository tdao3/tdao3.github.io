		<h2><strong>Power button</h2></strong>
		<p>
			When we did our toaster-oven websites both of them did not have a power button. 
			They were on standby until we picked an option and pressed the start button. 
			We thought that was a waste of electricity and instead we should have an on and off 
			button thats hidden in the back but is much easier to access than pulling out the cord at night 
			and plugging it back in the morning. 
		</p>
		<h2><strong>Light</strong></h2>
		<p>
			Another feature we added is light. We used light for the digital screen as well as 
			the dial. We thought about the dial on the microwave in SCE. Those dials always light 
			up based on how far you twist the dial. It's a small change but it makes it easier for
			anyone who moved the dial to see how far it went. We would also have the time and 
			temperature displayed on the digital screen but this just gives an added amount of 
			assurance. 
		</p>
		<h2><strong>Handle</h2></strong>
			<p>
				The door handle was chosen to be straight bar instead of a curved bar. This choice
				was due to the idea of "What happens if we grab the handle on the side instead of the center?"
				In turn by having a straight bar, no matter where you grab the handle, it'll be the same.
			</p>
			<p>
				The handle will be opened by pulling. Users are encouraged to pull from the handle and to not push the oven-toaster door expecting it to open.
			</p>
		<h2><strong>Door</h2></strong>
			<p>
				The door will be a normal glass door you can find in almost any type of toaster oven. Ideas were pushed to having the entire casing made of steel or wood,
				but due to strong opposition, we have decided on a normal glass door. There will be door stoppers to stop it from slamming in when you're in a hurry to 
				close to door.
			</p>
		<h2><strong>Bottom Shelf/Removable Crumb Tray </h2></strong>
			<p>
				Crumbs are messy. Crumbs attract ants. We don't want ants in the house. In order to combat this ordeal, we have included a tray at the bottom
				of the toaster-oven to catch all crumbs that may fall off food being toasted. No crumbs left behind we would say.
			</p>
		<h2><strong>LED Screen</h2></strong>
			<p>
				We want to have the LED Screen be the driving force for users to interact with the toaster oven. 
				Most of the display will be centered on the LED screen. It will provide information about temp, timers, and/or presets with their specific temp and time. We decided on a screen because its a more precise way of seeing what youre setting instead of eyeballing 
				from a dial. 
			
			</p>
		<h2><strong>Panels</h2></strong>
		<p>
			We used buttons for the different modes of the toaster oven with labels on top of them. This makes it easier for any user to 
			use the toaster oven as get acquainted with it. The dial is simple since all the functions use it. The digital screen shows whats
			happening and what mode it's in so the user does'nt get confused.
		</p>
		<h2><strong>Buttons</h2></strong>
			<p>
				We will include 3 buttons. Those buttons will include temp, timer, and presets. This will 
				provide the user with quick and easy selections. Once a button is pressed, a LED below will light up,
				indicating what the user has pressed. This will stop any confusion if the user forgot what he/she is currently
				setting. 
			</p>
		<h2><strong>Dial/Knob</h2></strong>
			<p>
				The dial helps speed up the process of changing the temperature or timer instead of using two buttons for up and down.
